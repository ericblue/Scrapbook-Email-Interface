[Overview]

The following code enables webpages to be captured and initiated from another device
not running the Firefox Scrapbook plugin.  Simply email a link to a designated email
address and the script will check the email, send the request to the Scrapbook-enabled
POW (Plain Old Webserver) browser, and capture the page.  

This is accomplished with 2 main modules:

1) Email interface (Perl)
2) Scrapbook/POW bridge (Server-side Javascript)
